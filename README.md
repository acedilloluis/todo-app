## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project allowed me to work with several important parts of React. These parts are hooks, namely useState, useEffect and useRef and conditional rendering. Apart from working with and learning React, I also learned how to implement a theme switcher use the HTML data attribute. 

### Continued development

In future React projects I'd like to work with different types of hooks and React libraries.
